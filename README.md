# queryFinder
A project for the first project for the subject COMP10002 Foundations of Algorithm 2017 Semester 2

## What does it do
The code basically takes in queries in the form of words and a long text.
The code then finds the words in the queries from each line of the text and for each line, the code will give a score based on a scoring equation.
After it goes through all the lines in the text, it will then sort the lines based on the score and pick the top 5 that is the most similar to the query.
